# **Hi there** 👋

I'm Ekemini.  
I build and develop __Embedded Systems__. I'm driven by a passion for bringing hardware to life through software and a fascination with the challenges of resource-constrained environments.

My toolkit includes C++, Python, Git, and various microcontroller architectures (e.g., ARM Cortex-M, AVR). I'm also currently learning x86 Assembly to deepen my understanding of how C/C++ runs at the lowest level.

## Projects I'm currently working on:
- **Tic-Tac-Toe** – A GUI Windows app built with SDL3 and Winsock to play online against friends  
  🔗 [GitHub](https://github.com/Ekemini-Udofia/Tic-tac-toe)
- **Power Monitoring Hub** – An ESP32-powered system that detects and logs home electricity supply, featuring a real-time web dashboard

Beyond this, I'm continuously expanding my knowledge by exploring the Internet of Things (IoT) and Embedded Linux.

If you find my work intriguing or share similar interests in embedded systems, Linux, or C++, I'd be thrilled to connect. Leave a ⭐ if you appreciate what you see!
